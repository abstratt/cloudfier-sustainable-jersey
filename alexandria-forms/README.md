### Alexandria: Online Public Records and Forms

In an effort to increase citizen participation and make government more
efficient, Alexandria needs help digitizing certain public records and bring
government functions online (i.e. interactive forms, applications, permits,
service requests, etc.) The Township doesn't have the finances to fix these
problems and come up with solutions. 

### Impact statement by Alexandria

New Jersey Municipalities face budget shortfalls on a yearly basis. Municipalities  need to make hard decisions when it comes to cutting taxes whether it be a service or an employee in a department. In the meantime, residents want the services to continue because that is what they expect of their government. 

Along with budget shortfalls, technology is moving at such an accelerated pace that many Municipalities can’t catch up nor can they afford too. What would a resident think if they could get a service instantly while they are on the computer, tablet, or phone?  A resident gets frustrated when they come into an office and learn that the person in the department they are looking for only works one day a week and it’s not the day they are in the office to have their questions answered. This occurs daily in Alexandria Township. 

Alexandria Township is a rural Township in Hunterdon County with approximately 4,900 residents , 1 full-time Municipal Clerk, and all other departments are part-time with limited weekly and/or monthly hours. Many other municipalities that surround us in Hunterdon County and neighboring rural Counties face the same challenges of part-time employees, small budgets, and tech savvy residents. 

We submitted a request to have a team through the NJ Sustainable Technology competition come up with software to make New Jersey municipalities a “ virtual municipality”. Residents can handle their Municipal affairs at the comfort of their home without worrying about if an employee from a particular department is available. A resident could process their dog license, pay or look up a tax bill, apply for a permit, apply for a raffle license, etc. without having to go to the municipality in person. 

There is software out there that does perform some of these services to an extent, but how many different programs, apps, and  fees does a municipality have to pay to make this a reality for the municipality itself and the residents. My team has taken on a challenge to make the technological future of  municipalities’ possible and one day provide municipalities’ the affordability and technologic services that are being driven and expected in today’s market by consumers.
