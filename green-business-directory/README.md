Many in Sustainable Jersey have directories highlighting green businesses or farms, vendors that use locally produced goods or that have green practices, and farmers markets.  This helps to promote local businesses while strengthening the local economy.

Enables entry of information about each business/farmers market and how it stacks up to community goals and sustainability practices. Shows how patronizing local/green businesses contribute to sustainability. Has education tips.
