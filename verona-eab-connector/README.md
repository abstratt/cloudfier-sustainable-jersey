### Verona: EAB connector

The tree-killing Emerald Ash Borer (EAB) has been detected in
Montclair and it will be in Verona soon. We would like to help
residents be able to identify if they have ash trees in their
properties, so they can retain a N.J. Certified Tree Expert or ISA
Certified Arborist to inspect trees and develop a plan of action.
Outreach and education to residents on the municipal EAB plan and
proper treatment advice is needed. 

Solution: Emerald Ash Borer Connector - Platform that connects residents with\
certified tree experts or ISA certified arborists for tree inspections\
and development of plans of action; with a component for\
identification of ash tress on property
