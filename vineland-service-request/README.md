Service Request Response Mobile App: for community / environmental issues 
needing attention. For residents use to report issues such as potholes, 
litter, missing signs, blocked storm drains, illegal dumping, graffiti, 
information on trees, and more. 
The features that would be useful are: The user would send a picture, 
and the App would capture GPS coordinates of the issue, along with a short 
form or space provided for brief text and/or a dropdown box of common issues. 
(Perhaps the information could be saved by the user to submit later). 
The report would be sent to an email address, and concurrently the same 
information would be loaded to a map for City use only. 
The app would capture the phone information (senderâ€™s email) so that 
the resident could receive a report back when the issue is resolved.
